molly-guard (0.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Josh Triplett ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Skip molly-guard's protection logic if we don't have the "tty" command to

    /usr mounted. (Closes: #771572)

molly-guard (0.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Fix and rework prefix and etcdir handling to not embed the build directory
    in the binary. (Closes: #768418)

 -- Josh Triplett <josh@joshtriplett.org>  Fri, 07 Nov 2014 03:42:41 -0800

molly-guard (0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Improve handling for guarded commands that call other guarded commands: if
    called recursively (detected via MOLLYGUARD_CMD environment variable),
    unconditionally run the real command.  Suggested by Sam Hartman at
    DebConf.
  * Install the molly-guard wrapper script to the same filesystem as the
    programs that link to it.
  * Support running the real utilities from a location other than /sbin,
    determined at build time by passing REALPATH to make.
  * Support setting an sbindir other than sbin in the prefix; this allows
    setting a prefix of /usr but an sbindir of /sbin.
  * Prevent gzip from interactively prompting about overwriting if
    molly-guard.8.gz already exists.
  * Drop lintian override for
    depends-on-essential-package-without-using-version, since molly-guard no
    longer depends on sysvinit.
  * Add Enhances for init and systemd.
  * Use diversions rather than /usr/sbin.  Divert the guarded commands to
    /lib/molly-guard, and install links in their place, rather than relying on
    /usr/sbin's position in $PATH.  This avoids installing different files to
    /sbin and /usr/sbin.  (Closes: #660064)
  * Add myself as an uploader.

molly-guard (0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Shield shutdown -h; I am terribly sorry, Andrew! (closes: #426107).
    Now only shutdown -c and * --help are passed through regardless.
  * Added --help option, which now prints a short molly-guard help message
    followed by the actual command's help output.
  * Now should also work in su/sudo sessions because it now checks whether the
    creator of the current tty/pts is sshd, rather than the brittle check for
    the environment. Thanks to Craig Small and Don Armstrong for their sparks
    of brilliance (closes: #425831).
  * Corrected a typo in the package description (closes: #408706).
  * Added --pretend-ssh option to facilitate testing.
